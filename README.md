## üß† Reasoning and Thinking

CodeGen CLI now includes advanced reasoning capabilities that show the AI's thought process and provide step-by-step problem solving:

### Reasoning Features

- **Multiple Strategies**: Choose from different reasoning approaches
- **Step-by-Step Thinking**: See the AI's thought process broken down
- **Confidence Tracking**: Each reasoning step includes confidence levels
- **Reasoning History**: Track and review past reasoning sessions
- **Integration with Generation**: Use reasoning to improve code quality

### Reasoning Strategies

\`\`\`bash
# Available reasoning strategies:
step_by_step           # Systematic step-by-step analysis
problem_decomposition  # Break complex problems into parts  
first_principles      # Reason from fundamental concepts
analogical           # Use analogies and similar problems
critical_thinking    # Question assumptions and evaluate evidence
\`\`\`

### CLI Reasoning Commands

\`\`\`bash
# Think through a problem
python cli.py think "optimize database performance"

# Use specific reasoning strategy
python cli.py think "design microservices architecture" --strategy problem_decomposition

# Generate code with reasoning
python cli.py generate-with-reasoning "create authentication system" --strategy first_principles

# Hide thinking process (show only results)
python cli.py think "implement caching" --no-thinking
\`\`\`

### REPL Reasoning Commands

\`\`\`bash
# In REPL mode:
think create a REST API                    # Think through problem step-by-step
reason critical_thinking debug this code   # Use specific strategy
analyze app.py                            # Analyze code file
strategies                                # Show available strategies
reasoning                                 # Show reasoning history
generate "create API" --reasoning         # Generate with reasoning
\`\`\`

### Reasoning Example

\`\`\`bash
codegen:~ [gpt-3.5-turbo] $ think "create a scalable web scraper"

ü§î Reasoning through: create a scalable web scraper
Strategy: step_by_step

üîç Step 1: Problem Analysis
Understanding the problem: "create a scalable web scraper"
- Main objective: Extract data from websites efficiently
- Constraints: Handle rate limiting, avoid blocking
- Technologies: Python requests, async/await, proxies
- Challenges: Anti-bot measures, dynamic content
- Success criteria: Fast, reliable, respectful scraping

üéØ Step 2: Solution Planning  
Based on analysis, here's my solution plan:
1. Choose async architecture for concurrency
2. Implement rate limiting and retry logic
3. Add proxy rotation and user agent rotation
4. Plan for error handling and logging
5. Consider robots.txt compliance

‚öôÔ∏è Step 3: Implementation Design
Implementation strategy:
- Use aiohttp for async HTTP requests
- Implement exponential backoff for retries
- Add configurable delays between requests
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Make it extensible with plugins

‚úÖ Step 4: Approach Validation
Validating the approach:
‚úì Solves scalability through async processing
‚úì Addresses rate limiting and blocking
‚úì Includes proper error handling
‚úì Follows web scraping best practices

‚ú® Reasoning Complete!
Confidence: 85% | Time: 2.3s | Steps: 4
\`\`\`

### Integration with Code Generation

When using reasoning with code generation, the AI:

1. **Analyzes** the problem systematically
2. **Plans** the solution approach  
3. **Designs** the implementation strategy
4. **Validates** the approach
5. **Generates** code based on the reasoning

This results in higher quality, more thoughtful code that addresses edge cases and follows best practices.

## üîß Automatic Testing and Fixing

CodeGen CLI now includes powerful auto-fix capabilities that automatically test generated code and fix common issues:

### Auto-Fix Features

- **Automatic Testing**: Every generated code is automatically tested for syntax and runtime errors
- **Intelligent Fixing**: Multiple fix strategies are applied to resolve issues
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicators show testing and fixing steps
- **Fix Summaries**: Detailed reports of what was fixed and how

### Fix Strategies

The auto-fix engine uses multiple strategies in order:

1. **Syntax Error Fixes**: Correct indentation, missing colons, brackets
2. **Import Error Fixes**: Replace unavailable modules with alternatives
3. **Runtime Error Fixes**: Add missing variable definitions
4. **Error Handling**: Wrap code in try-catch blocks
5. **Structure Fixes**: Add proper function/class structure

### CLI Auto-Fix Commands

\`\`\`bash
# Generate code with automatic testing and fixing
python cli.py generate-auto "create a web scraper"

# Skip reasoning for faster generation
python cli.py generate-auto "create calculator" --no-reasoning

# Skip auto-testing
python cli.py generate-auto "create function" --no-autotest

# Save directly to file
python cli.py generate-auto "create API" -o api.py
\`\`\`

### REPL Auto-Fix Commands

\`\`\`bash
# In REPL mode:
generate-auto "create a Flask server"    # Generate with auto-testing
gen-auto "implement sorting algorithm"   # Short alias
tasks                                    # Show current tasks
tasks stats                             # Show session statistics
tasks 1                                 # Show details for task #1
autotest on/off                         # Toggle auto-testing
next                                    # Ask for next task
\`\`\`

## üìã Task Management

CodeGen CLI includes a built-in task management system for continuous development:

### Task Features

- **Automatic Task Creation**: Each generation request becomes a tracked task
- **Status Tracking**: Tasks are marked as pending, in-progress, completed, or failed
- **Fix History**: All fix attempts are recorded for each task
- **Session Statistics**: Track success rates and productivity metrics
- **Continuous Workflow**: Automatic prompting for next tasks

### Task Workflow Example

\`\`\`bash
codegen:~ [gpt-3.5-turbo] $ generate-auto "create a calculator class"

üöÄ Starting Task #1
create a calculator class

ü§î Reasoning through: create a calculator class
üß™ Testing Generated Code
üîß Fix Attempt 1/3: Attempting fix...
‚úÖ Fix successful with strategy: _fix_syntax_errors
‚úÖ Code fixed successfully after 1 attempts!

üìã Fix Summary:
‚úÖ Successfully fixed code after 1 attempts
  ‚úÖ Attempt 1: _fix_syntax_errors
     ‚Üí Fixed syntax_error

üìã Task Recap: #1
Task:     create a calculator class
Status:   completed
Duration: 0:00:15
Fixes Applied: 1

üéØ Ready for next task!
Session stats: 1 completed, 0 pending, 100.0% success rate

What would you like me to work on next?
Examples:
  ‚Ä¢ Create a web scraper for news articles
  ‚Ä¢ Add authentication to the existing API
  ‚Ä¢ Optimize the database queries
  ‚Ä¢ Write unit tests for the calculator

Next task: add unit tests for the calculator
\`\`\`

### Session Statistics

Track your development productivity:

- **Total Tasks**: Number of tasks attempted
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successfully completed tasks
- **Fix Attempts**: Average number of fixes needed per task
- **Session Duration**: Total time spent in development session

### Continuous Development Loop

The enhanced workflow creates a continuous development experience:

1. **Generate**: AI creates code based on your request
2. **Test**: Code is automatically tested for issues
3. **Fix**: Any problems are automatically resolved
4. **Recap**: Summary of what was accomplished
5. **Next**: Prompt for the next development task
6. **Repeat**: Seamless continuation of development work

This creates an efficient, automated development assistant that handles the tedious parts of coding while keeping you focused on the creative aspects.
